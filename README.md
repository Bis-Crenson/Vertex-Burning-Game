# Vertex-Burning-Game
This was a research project I did during my sophomore year at Adelphi involving random AI
You can modify the game settings in the Main.java file
This game uses a ternary format, which looks like this:
          o
        o o o
      ooo ooo ooo
Player 1 picks a vertex, and then player 2 picks a vertex
Once they pick their vertex, then the program will see if each vertex is connected to a connecting vertex.
If the vertex is connected to only one other player and not both players, then that vertex will go under that players control.
But if there's two players connected to a vertex, then a player has to manually select it when it's their turn to chose a vertex.
